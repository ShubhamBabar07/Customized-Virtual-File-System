Project Name : Customised Virtual File System

Technology : C AND C++

Platform Required : Windows Platform Or Linux Distributions.

Architecturel Requirement : 32 Bit Processor Or Higher.

User Interface : Command Line Interface.

Description :   
    In This Project Emulated Data Structures Which Are Used By Operating System To Manage File System Oriented Tasks.

    As The Name Suggests It's Virtual Because Maintained All The Records In Primary Storage (RAM).

    In This Project Created All Data Structures Which Required For File Subsystems As : FT, UAREA, UFDT, SB, DILB, DB etc.

    Provided All Implementations Of Necessary System Calls And Commands Of File subsystem As : Open, Close, Read, Write, 
    Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc.

    While Creating This Project All Above Functionality Used Our Own Data Structures By Referring Algorithms of UNIX Operating System.

    By Using This Project We Can Get Overview Of UFS (UNIX File System) On Any Platform.
